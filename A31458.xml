         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe principal ſcope and intent of the poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Statutes here preſented to thy view, is, To aſſert the Kings Eccleſiaſtical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; To aboliſh the exerciſe of that which is forreign and was uſurped, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the entrance of ſuch into the Realm who would reſtore that which is aboliſhed; To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Reconciliation of the Kings Subjects to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Education in the Religion there profeſſed and taught; To oblige them by Oaths (held one of the moſt ſtrict and ſacred tyes among men) to that Obedience which they owe their Prince; To take away from ſeditious and dangerous perſons the power of doing hurt; To procure a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conformity to the Religion eſtabliſhed, and to inflict capital and other puniſhments on the infringers of theſe Laws.</p>
            <p>'Tis no part of my deſign to ſharpen this two edged Sword, but only to take off ſome
<pb facs="tcp:58209:3"/> of its ruſt, that, by the brightneſs, it may be the better diſcerned and avoided; And to give ſome light (ſuch as my own obſcurity will afford) what are the juſt meaſures to be taken, in reference to the Laws here treated of.</p>
            <p>The Judgments and Reſolutions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Judges upon the ſeveral branches of theſe Statutes, and of others likewiſe here occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally mentioned, (as far as they relate to the ſubject in hand) which lye ſcattered in the printed Books, are here collected and placed under proper heads; And this is the only thing, the Statutes themſelves excepted, for which I durſt recommend the Book to thy peruſal.</p>
            <p>Beſides which, there are ſeveral other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities cited in the Caſes, which ariſe upon theſe poenal Laws: And here and there, where the path is untrodden, I have adventured to add ſome obſervations of my own.</p>
            <p>Wherein, I am ſenſible enough how great a hazard I run: But my Apology ſhall be, that they are offered only as probable Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (and ſo I would be underſtood) which where Authorities fail, can have no other <hi>Baſis</hi> to fix themſelves on, then the Rules of Law,
<pb facs="tcp:58209:3"/> aptly applied by the ſtrength of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And if in any of them, the Reaſon offered ſhall by the learned be thought too weak, or the Rule of Law miſapplied; I ſhall not inſiſt upon the misfortunes of others, who have made Eſſays of the like nature, as a juſt excuſe for mine; but ſupport my ſelf with this hope, that ſuch will be moſt ready to pardon me, who are the beſt able to cenſure me; and that where I find the one, I ſhall not fail of the other.</p>
            <p>As for the miſtakes which I have noted in thoſe who have written more or leſs upon theſe Statutes, I preſume, what I have done cannot be taken amiſs, ſeeing my aim is no other then theirs was, to repreſent things truly as they are, (though we may ſometimes miſs the mark:) And I was the rather induced to rectifie them, for that I found divers of them con-concern the Juſtices of Peace, whoſe leiſure or inclinations may not always ſerve them to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe the Statutes at large, and who, by truſting to thoſe ſhorter Tracts or Abridgments they have by them, may be miſled in the execution of their Office.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58209:4"/>
            <p>There is only one thing more, which is to give thee notice, that where I cite <hi>Wingate,</hi> 'tis intended of his Abridgment of the Statutes; a work laborious enough, but not always complying with the ſenſe of the Statute A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged, and therefore, here in ſeveral places corrected.</p>

               <hi>Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> 4. <hi>Inſt.</hi> 331. in his conſtruction of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſaith, That no perſons ſhall be impeached for any of the Offences by Preaching, Teaching, or words, unleſs they be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully indicted within the ſpace of half a year; But yet it ſeems that the words of the Statute will not bear ſuch a Conſtruction, neither if they did, is it Law at this day, nor was when thoſe Inſtitutes were written. For 1. The Statute where it ſpeaks of half a year, refers only to the Caſe of Impriſonment, That where the Offender by Preaching, Teaching, or words, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and is not indicted within half a year after the Offence committed, he ſhall be ſet at liberty, and be no longer detained in Priſon for any ſuch Cauſe or Offence, and this was done in favour of liberty, and to prevent a long Impriſonment upon a malicious and groundleſs Accuſation. But there is no colour to extend the words to the Offender who was never impriſoned, although the Offence was by Preaching, Teaching, or words only. 2. But the Caſe that an Offender by Preaching, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or words, had been impriſoned within the half year, yet it ſeems very queſtionable, whether at the half years end when he was ſet at liberty (as he ought to be by this Act, if he be not in the mean time indicted) he ſhould have been clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by this Act from any proſecution</hi>
               <note place="margin">Proſecution.</note> 
               <hi>during the half year then next following. For although it be ſaid he ſhall be no longer detained in Priſon for any ſuch Cauſe or Offence, yet that ſeems to refer only to his Impriſonment before Conviction; and</hi> (detained) <hi>imports as much, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould not be continued, or remain in the ſame Impriſonment which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered within the firſt half year before any Indictment was found againſt him, but not that he ſhould not be indicted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards within the compaſs of the year, and if found guilty, ſuffer the Impriſonment, and other penalties inflicted by this Act. And it might ſo have happened, that an Offender by Preaching, Teaching, or words, might have been accuſed, taken and impriſoned a day or two before the half year next after the offence expired. In which Caſe it cannot be thought to be the meaning of the makers of the Law, that by his Impriſonment for a day or two he ſhould eſcape the penalties of the Law, and could not be afterwards indicted within the compaſs of the year. And yet in that caſe he ought to be ſet at liberty by the expreſs words of the Act, which ſaith,</hi> He ſhall be ſet at liberty if not indicted within half a year after the Offence, <hi>and not half a year after his Impriſonment. 3. It ſeems now to be out
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58209:12"/> of doubt but that any Offender againſt this Act, although by Preaching, Teaching, or words, may be indicted at any time within a year and a day after the Offence committed, and that by force of the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. which ſaith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stat. 23 Eliz. 1.</note> 
               <hi>that all Offences againſt the Acts of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> touching Acknowledgment of her Majeſties ſupream government in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, ſhall and may be inquirable within a year and a day after the Offence committed. And the affirming or maintaining the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction of a Forreigner, was without queſtion an Offence againſt her Majeſties ſupream Government in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, and againſt the acknowledgment thereof, ſo that the year limited by this Statute is now extended to a day farther, and whatever the meaning of it was as to the half year: All Offences againſt it, whether by Preaching, Teaching, or words, or otherwiſe (for that of 23. is general, and reaches all Offences whatſoever againſt the Act of 1<hi rend="sup">0.</hi> touching the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy Eccleſiaſtical) may now be inquired of within a year and a day, whether the party be in Priſon or not.</hi>

            <p>In Dr. <hi>Fosters</hi> Caſe, <hi>Co.</hi> 11.65. it's ſaid. That the Informer hath no Remedy for recovery of the forfeiture for Recuſancy, after the year and day is expired, for that time is limited in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by this Act; But yet with ſubmiſſion it ſeems the Clauſe in this Act which limits to a year and a day,<note place="margin">And hath not a year and a day.</note> relates to Indictments only: And ſo it was held in this very Caſe of Dr. <hi>Foſter, Co.</hi> 11. 60. <hi>&amp; Rolles</hi> 1.93. <hi>C.</hi> 41. and in <hi>Pie</hi> and <hi>Lovells</hi> Caſe, <hi>Hobart</hi> 205. and there was no limitation of time for the Informer, <hi>Qui tam, &amp;c.</hi> upon this Statute, until the ſaid Statute of 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which limits him to a year after the Offence committed, and not a year and a day. And although this Offence of Recuſancy cannot in ſtrictneſs be ſaid to be committed, for that in truth it is but a bare omiſſion as hath been ſaid, and therefore there needs not be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58209:42"/> any place alledged, yet in common parlance it will paſs well enough for an Offence committed,<note place="margin">To what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Recuſancy may be ſaid to be committed.</note> and ſeems to be within the meaning of that Branch of 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which limits the time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: And in this very Clauſe of the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it's ſaid, the third part of the forfeiture for Recuſancy ſhall be to the Poor in the Pariſh where the Offence is committed. Now if it be objected, That if Recuſancy be not an Offence which is to be laid in the proper County by that Statute of 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> becauſe 'tis not an Offence which can be properly ſaid to be committed; By the ſame reaſon the Informer who is reſtrained by that Statute to a year after the Offence committed, is not reſtrained in the Caſe of Recuſancy; Nor the Poor of any Pariſh can take any benefit by this Statute as to the third part of the forfeiture, for that there is no Pariſh wherein Recuſancy can be ſaid to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: I anſwer, there is a great difference between thoſe Caſes: For in the Caſes of limitation of time when the Offence muſt be proſecuted, and that of the Poor of the Pariſh, where the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture is to be diſtributed, the word (committed) is no part of the ſubſtance of the matter, and 'tis no more then if the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes had ſaid, within a year after the Offence, and to the Pariſh where the Offence was; And there (committed) may be taken well in that ſenſe;<note place="margin">And to what intent, not.</note> but it cannot be ſo in that other Caſe about the proper County: For the Statute of 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which appoints, that in any Declaration or Information the Offence againſt any penal Statute ſhall not be laid to be done in any other County but where the matter alledged to be the Offence, was in truth done, and the Defendant may traverſe, and alledge that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſuppoſed to be committed was not committed in ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty where the Offence is alledged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes the Commiſſion of the Offence matter of ſubſtance, and whether it were committed or not committed in the County where it is laid in the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or popular Suit, goes now to the merits of the Cauſe. For if it were not committed in that County, and the Defendant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and traverſe it, and it be found for him, the Plaintiff ſhall be barred: And thoſe words (that he may traverſe that it was not committed) clearly ſhew, that Offences which conſiſt only in omiſſion, were not intended: For otherwiſe neither Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancy, nor any other Offence of that nature could be puniſhed by any Information or popular Action: For the Jury upon their Oaths muſt of neceſſity find that it was not committed in any County, for that in truth and propriety of ſpeech it was not committed at all. <hi>Vide ſupra Sect.</hi> 5.</p>

And the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hobart</hi> in his Report of <hi>Pie</hi> and <hi>Lovells</hi> Caſe ſaith, That that Obſervation was made (as he takes it) by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> himſelf; But however this paſſage or obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as he calls it) came to be inſerted by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>Report;</hi> Sergeant <hi>Rolles</hi> in his Report of that Caſe of Dr. <hi>Foſter lib.</hi> 1. 93. <hi>C.</hi> 41. brings him in ſpeaking in another Language, and more conſonant to Law, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction here mentioned is intended of Convictions upon Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only, and that no other ſort of Convictions or proceedings upon the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> are mentioned or intended through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58209:55"/> this whole Act of 29. And if ſo, then the Informer is not concerned in this Act, nor reſtrained thereby as to the Courts wherein he is to ſue, but that he may ſue ſtill in the Common Pleas or Exchequer. And ſo was it reſolved in point, in that Caſe of <hi>Pie</hi> and <hi>Lovell. Hobart</hi> 204, 205. where the Opinion of Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> reported by <hi>Rolles</hi> touching what ſort of Conviction is meant here, is confirmed and allowed for Law, (this Statute being made only for the benefit of the Queen in her Suits by Indictment) and that other Opinion in the 11 Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port exploded: And the true reaſon is there given, why thoſe negative words <hi>(and not elſewhere)</hi> were added here, <hi>viz.</hi> not to exclude the Informer out of the Common Pleas or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, but to reſtrain Juſtices of Peace from proceeding to convict any perſon upon Indictments for Recuſancy, or for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing or being at Maſs, which they were enabled to do by 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> but again diſenabled by thoſe negative words in this Act, and the hearing and determining of thoſe offences commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only to the Juſtices of the Kings Bench, Aſſizes and general Goal delivery: But for Informations by a common Informer, they were never intended here, and the Juſtices of Aſſize and Goal delivery cannot hold Plea of ſuch Informations, as was reſolved by the Judges <hi>Mich.</hi> 4 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Jones</hi> 193.</p>

               <hi>Once convicted.]</hi> This Statute meddles not with any other way of Conviction, then at the Queens Suit by Indictment, as hath been ſaid. And ſo is the Conviction here mentioned to be underſtood: For this Statute is not introductory of a new Law, nor gave the Queen any new or other remedy then what ſhe had againſt the Recuſant by the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. that is, by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58209:56"/> Indictment, but only gave her a more ſpeedy way of proceeding upon that fundamental remedy. <hi>Co.</hi> 11. 60. Dr. <hi>Foſters</hi> Caſe. <hi>Rolles</hi> 1. 93. <hi>C.</hi> 41. the ſame Caſe; ſo that a Conviction upon an Information againſt the Recuſant upon 23. or any other way ſave by Indictment, doth not appropriate the penalty of twenty pounds <hi>per</hi> month to the King for the time to come, by force of this Statute. <hi>Hobart</hi> 205. <hi>Pye</hi> and <hi>Lovells</hi> Caſe; nor (for the ſame reaſon) by force of that 3 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 4. where the ſame words are uſed, and a Conviction by Indictment only intended, as here.</p>
            <p>In that Caſe of <hi>Pye</hi> and <hi>Lovell</hi> its ſaid, That if a man at the making of this Statute, had been convicted of Recuſancy by any other means then by Indictment, he had not been bound by this Law to pay the twenty ſhillings <hi>(It ſhould be twenty pounds)</hi> a month from the Conviction. And if a man be now convicted in the Kings Bench by Indictment or otherwiſe, he cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed nor otherwiſe his penalty run on; which laſt words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that the Conviction here intended, is only a Conviction ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Statute by Proclamation upon default. But if we compare together this Clauſe which ſpeaks of a Conviction after the making of this Statute, and the former Clauſe which ſpeaks of a Conviction before this Statute, the contrary will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear: For the former Clauſe touching Conviction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Statute, muſt neceſſarily be intended of Convictions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to 23 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. without any Proclamation: For the Proclamation in the Caſe of Recuſancy was not given until 29. And if a man had been convicted of Recuſancy upon Indictment in the Kings Bench or elſewhere before this Act, the forfeiture of 20 <hi>l. per</hi> month ſhould by force of this Act have run on from the time of ſuch Conviction, that's clear by the expreſs words of the former Clauſe. Then comes this Clauſe, which provides what ſhall be done upon Convictions for the future, and appoints in that Caſe likewiſe the forfeiture of 26 <hi>l. per</hi> month to run on from the time of Conviction. Both which Convictions, as well before as after this Statute, are granted to be meant only of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions upon Indictment; And there is no difference between the penning of theſe two Clauſes, but that one reſpects the time paſt, and the other the time to come, but both appoint the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty to run on. Now there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that the makers of the Law intended the word <hi>(Convicted)</hi> in a more reſtrained ſenſe in this Clauſe, then in the former Clauſe where the penalty ſhould have run on upon any conviction whatſoever upon Indictment, or that the conviction in the former Clauſe by Indictment upon 23. without Proclamation ſhould be wholly ſhut out of the later Clauſe. By <hi>(Conviction)</hi> therefore in theſe two Clauſes ſeems to be meant ſuch Convictions upon Indictment
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58209:57"/> as were warranted by the Statutes in force at the ſeveral and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective times here mentioned: That is, in the former which ſpeaks of the time foregoing, a Conviction upon 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Proclamation, and in this later which ſpeaks of the time to come, a Conviction either with or without a Proclamation: In either of which Caſes the penalty of 20 <hi>l. per</hi> month ſhall run on by force of this Act; and conſequently it ſhall run on, if the Recuſant be Indicted, Convicted and adjudged in the Kings Bench, although he cannot be proclaimed there. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it was agreed in Dr. <hi>Foſters</hi> Caſe, that where the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant is convicted upon Indictment, the penalty ſhould ever after run on, and be appropriated to the King, <hi>Roiles</hi> 1. 93. <hi>C.</hi> 41. And 'tis not reſtrained there to a Conviction upon Proclamation only.</p>
            <p>But yet although this Clauſe extends as well to a Conviction upon 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> as to a Conviction by Proclamation, yet every Conviction upon 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> is not here intended: For if a man Indicted of Recuſancy do upon his Arraignment confeſs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment to be true and plead guilty, or upon Trial a Verdict paſs againſt him, theſe are Convictions in Law, but yet by theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions he forfeits nothing until Judgment: nor ſhall the penalty of 20 <hi>l. per</hi> month run on, or be appropriated to the King until Judgment be given: By <hi>(Convicted)</hi> therefore is here to be underſtood convicted by Proclamation and Default, or convicted by Verdict, Confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and adjudged; for ſo the word is here to be taken, <hi>viz.</hi> for adjudged or attainted, unleſs it be in Caſe of Conviction upon Proclamation: And in ſuch a ſenſe it is to be taken in divers other Caſes.<note place="margin">Stat. 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1</note>

And the Opinion of thoſe who held that the ſeizure ſhould neither enſue nor continue after his death, but that the Arrears were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, was principally grounded upon the aforeſaid conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>(due and payable)</hi> extended only
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58209:60"/> to Arrearages due and payable upon a Judgment, and converted into a Debt: But when the Recuſant was convicted by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the penalty was never converted into a Debt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he died there were no Arrearages due in the ſenſe of this Statute for the heir to pay; And yet that by <hi>(ſuch Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> here is generally intended all Recuſants convicted, as well by Proclamation upon default as upon Judgment; and the heirs of either ſhould have had the benefit of this Proviſo, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That upon the death of the Anceſtor no ſeizure ſhould enſue, or be continued; only in the Caſe of a Judgment the Arrears were to have been paid.</p>
            <p>But there ſeems now to be no further need of this Queſtion, for the Statute of 1 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Stat. 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4.</note> meets with both theſe Caſes: For if there be no ſeizure of the Recuſants Lands in his life time, the diſcharge of the heir will depend upon his Conformity; and if there were a ſeizure, the two parts ſhall continue in his Majeſties poſſeſſion till the Arrears are paid and ſatisfied.</p>

               <note place="margin">Intailed Lands when diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and when not.</note>But this is not intended of intailed Lands: For without any aid of this Proviſo, if a Recuſant Tenant in Tail be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by Proclamation upon default and dies, neither any ſeizure for the Arrears of the 20 <hi>l. per</hi> month ſhall enſue after his death; nor if they were ſeized in his life time ſhall the ſeizure be continued after his death; nor is the Heir in Tail bound to pay any ſuch Arrears: But if a Judgment be had againſt the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Tenant in Tail in his life time, the Heir is bound in that Caſe, of which ſee farther in <hi>Stat.</hi> 1 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>If a Judgment was had againſt the Recuſant before the ſaid Statute of 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> and he had died before ſeizure of the two parts of his Lands, The queſtion was, whether after his death they might have been ſeized by force of this Statute of 29. for the Arrears of the penalty incurred in his life time: For that the ſeizure here given is meerly in nature of a <hi>nomine poenae,</hi> or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty inflicted for his contempt in not paying the 20 <hi>l per</hi> month, and ſhould not have gone in ſatisfaction of the Debt; But the Queen ſhould have held the Land till the 20 <hi>l. per</hi> month were otherwiſe paid and ſatisfied; And when this penalty of ſeizure was not executed in the Recuſants life time, by his death the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was gone, and conſequently the penalty inflicted for that contempt could not then be put in Execution. <hi>Vide Lane</hi> 92, 93. <hi>Beckets</hi> Caſe. <hi>Ibid.</hi> 107. <hi>Halſeys</hi> Caſe.</p>

            <p>And this conſtruction naturally flows from the Order wherein theſe two branches are placed: For the Statute ſpeaks of a Church, Chappel or uſual place of Common Prayer, before it mentions the parties refuſal to conform and ſubmit within three months next after Conviction; But when it hath mentioned ſuch refuſal, then it ſpeaks of the Pariſh Church only: And the ſecond time
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58209:64"/> here limited to the Offender when he may conform and ſubmit, <hi>viz.</hi> before he be warned or required to abjure, preſuppoſes his refuſal to conform and ſubmit within the three months: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he could not be required to abjure.</p>
            <p>But if the Offender be not required within the three months, according to this Act, to conform and ſubmit, it ſeems he is not afterwards limited to ſome Pariſh Church, but may do it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former branch of this Act, in any Church, Chappel or uſual place of Common Prayer, for he is then in no danger of Abjuration; and his Conformity and Submiſſion is then to no other end, but to free himſelf from the Impriſonment inflicted on him upon his Conviction: And in that Caſe the Act ſaith, he may conform and ſubmit in any Church, Chappel or uſual place of Common Prayer.</p>
            <p>Of this difference between the places of Conformity and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, no notice is taken in the late Additions to <hi>Dalton,</hi> but any Church or Chappel is made to ſerve the turn in all Caſes. <hi>cap.</hi> 81. tit. <hi>Recuſants Sect.</hi> 13.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58209:66"/> where he may be made party to the Action or Suit, as in an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Debt, Treſpaſs, Action of the Caſe for ſcandalous words by the Wife, &amp;c. but not upon an Indictment.

            <p>By comparing together this and the precedent Clauſe,<note place="margin">A Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed may be within this Act</note> it will appear plainly that the Statute puts a great difference between the Popiſh Recuſant who hath a certain place of abode in this Realm, and him that hath none: For to reſtrain a Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58209:71"/> who hath a certain place of abode within this Realm, from travelling above five miles, there are three Qualifications requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Act. 1. That he be convicted of Recuſancy. 2. That he be a Popiſh Recuſant at the time of his Conviction. 3. That at the time of ſuch Conviction he be within this Realm; And if either of theſe fail, he is not reſtrained by this Act. But if a Popiſh Recuſant have no certain place of abode within this Realm, but is ubiquitary, there no ſuch Qualifications are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; but if he be a Papiſt, and doth not uſually repair to Church, but forbears ſo to do, he ought to repair to the place where he was born, or where his Father or Mother dwelt, and not to remove above five miles from thence; and that whether he be convicted or not: For the Statute, when it comes to ſpeak of him who hath no certain place of abode, leaves out all the aforeſaid Qualifications required in him who hath a certain place of abode; and it clearly diſtinguiſhes between him who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed for not repairing to ſome Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which is required in thoſe whoſe abode is certain) and him who doth not uſually repair to ſome Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in thoſe whoſe abode is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain is ſufficient to bring them within the danger and penalty of this Law, if they repair not to the place appointed them by the Act, or remove above five miles from thence: And 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable that in this Clauſe which ſpeaks of the Popiſh Recuſant, who hath no certain place of abode, there is no mention made of Forty days to be allowed him after his Conviction, to repair to the place appointed him, the reaſon whereof is becauſe it takes in the whole kind of ſuch Popiſh Recuſants, as well the not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, as the convicted, and makes no diſtinction between them, if they have no certain place of abode, <hi>Et ubi lex non diſtinguit, nec nos diſtinguere debemus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was it without great reaſon, that ubiquitary Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants ſhould be confined, whether they were convicted or not convicted: As for the other who have a certain place of abode, it is to be preſumed, that the moſt conſiderable of them would be proſecuted and convicted for their Recuſancy in the reſpective places where they dwell, and <hi>de mini mis non curat lex</hi> may in this Caſe be applied to perſons, as well as in other Caſes to things: But as for him who is fixed to no certain place, as he is the more dangerous of the two, ſo the more unlikely to be proſecuted to a Conviction, being here one day and gone the next, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leſs taken notice of: And had the Statute taken in only ſuch as are convicted, it would have been eluded, and rendred ineffectual for want of a Conviction of the greater part of ſuch ubiquitary Recuſants.</p>

               <hi>Wilkinſon, P.</hi> 66. hath ſet down another form upon this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute (much reſembling that heretofore uſed at the Abjuration of a Felon <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi>) in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This hear you, Sir Coronor, that I</hi> J. M. <hi>of</hi> H. <hi>in the County of</hi> S. <hi>am a Popiſh Recuſant, and in Contempt of the Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>I have and do refuſe to come to hear Divine Service there read and exerciſed: I do therefore, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the intent and meaning of the Statute made in the</hi> 35th <hi>year of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>late Queen of this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>abjure the Land and Realm of King</hi> Charles, <hi>now King of</hi> England, Scotland, France <hi>and</hi> Ireland; <hi>and I ſhall hast me towards the Port of</hi> P. <hi>which you have given and aſſigned to me. And that I ſhall not go out of the highway leading thither, nor return back again; and if I do I will that I be taken as a Felon of our ſaid Lord the King: And that at</hi> P. <hi>I will diligently ſeek for paſſage, and I will tarry there but one Flood and Ebb, if I can have paſſage; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I can have it in ſuch ſpace, I will go every day into the Sea up to my Knees, aſſaying to paſs over. So God me help and his holy Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in alluding to the old Oath in Caſe of abjuration for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, which began with the Confeſſion of the particular offence for which the Felon was abjured, (as <hi>Ego</hi> A. B. <hi>ſum latro unius Equi, vel homicida unius hominis,</hi> or the like as the Caſe was) <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> is miſtaken in the very offence for which the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant is to abjure by force of this Statute: for the offence is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58209:74"/> not his refuſal to hear Divine Service; for that is but only one of the precedent Qualifications of the perſon. But the Offence it ſelf is of another nature, <hi>(viz.)</hi> his not repairing to the place the Statute appoints him, or his removal from thence contrary to the Statute, or his not preſenting himſelf, and delivering his true name as aforeſaid: Either of theſe, if he be a Popiſh Recuſant within the meaning of this Act, is a crime for which he ought to abjure, unleſs he prevents his Abjuration by a timely Submiſſion: Nor is the Popiſh Recuſant bound to ſwear, that he will not go out of the High way or return back, or will tarry but one flood and ebb, or go into the Sea up to his knees; nor ought the Coroner or Juſtices of Peace to require any ſuch Oath of him: For this is a new offence made by a Statute Law, which doth not require the ſtrict form of Abjuration as in Caſe of Felony. And although the Felon were tied to theſe circumſtances, yet the Recuſant is not, nor ſhall be a Felon for omitting them: But 'tis ſufficient if he ſimply abjure as the Act directs, and go from the appointed Port within the time limited, and not return without Licence into any of the Kings Dominions.</p>
            <p>He that thus abjures the Realm doth yet owe the King his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and remaineth within the Kings Protection.<note place="margin">He that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures, yet ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the King his Ligeance.</note>

            <p>And the reaſon why in the two laſt Caſes the Wife ſhall not be barred of her Dower, although there be an Eſtate limited to her for her life, is, becauſe the Eſtate is not in its firſt Creation appointed to take immediately after the death of the Husband; And no matter which ariſes <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> can ſalve this, or make it a Joynture within that Statute, to bar her Dower.</p>

            <p>And as in all the Caſes before mentioned, if the Eſtate were made for her Joynture, the Wife ſhall have ſuch Joynture and her Dower both, ſo (if ſhe be an Offender within this branch of the Act, and conform not within the year next before her Husbands death) ſhe ſhall forfeit the profits of two parts of both.</p>

            <p>And therefore if any of the Eſtates before mentioned, which are not within the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. be granted or limited to the Wife by the Husband, or any other Eſtate for her life or otherwiſe, which would be a good Joynture within the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, if it were intended for a Joynture, as if a man, before or after Marriage, Covenants to ſtand ſeized of Lands to the uſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for life, the Remainder to his Wife for her life, and it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſed in the Deed, nor can be averred and proved that it was for her Joynture; or if a man deviſe Lands by his laſt Will to his Wife generally, and there is no mention in the Will that 'tis for her Joynture, (for in this Caſe an Averment that it was ſo intended will not ſerve, unleſs there be expreſs words in the Will to that purpoſe:) Theſe Eſtates ſo gained by the Wife, as they do not bar her Dower out of the reſidue of her Husbands Eſtate, but that ſhe ſhall enjoy both the one and the other, <hi>Co.</hi> 4. 4. ſo they are not within the meaning of this Act, becauſe not made for her Joynture; And ſhe ſhall not forfeit the profits of two parts of them, although ſhe may forfeit the profits of 2 parts of her Dower which ſhe hath out of the reſidue of her Husbands Eſtate.</p>

And that the true reaſon, why the Biſhop ſhall not be admitted to plead an Excommunication pronounced by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in diſability of the perſon Excommunicated, is not becauſe he is a party to the Excommunication, but becauſe in matters of Excommunication the Biſhop acts as a Judge, and 'tis by his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Authority that the party is Excommunicated, and he ſhall not take advantage in another Suit of a Sentence given by himſelf judicially: And this will not hold in the Caſe of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, who though he be a party to the Suit in which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant is diſabled as an Excommunicate perſon, yet is no Judge in the Caſe, whether the party Sued ſhall be diſabled or no; as the Biſhop is in the other Caſe, where the party is actually Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by him. And if the Biſhop ſhould be barred to Plead and take advantage of ſuch Excommunication, becauſe he is a party thereunto, it would follow that the perſon who Sues in the Spiritual Court, and at whoſe inſtance the perſon Sued is Excommunicated, ſhould be barred likewiſe to take advantage of ſuch diſability in the Plaintiff at Law, for he is a party to the Excommunication, for that he is a party to the Suit, upon which the Excommunication is originally founded: But the contrary to this is ſtrongly implied in 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 14. where the Caſe was, <hi>A.</hi> was Excommunicated in a Suit depending between him and <hi>B.</hi> and afterwards <hi>A.</hi> Sues <hi>B.</hi> upon the Statute of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> who pleads this Excommunication in diſability of the Plaintiff: Here the Plea was diſallowed, becauſe the principal Suit on which the Excommunication depended was brought before the Pope; But in the debate of the Caſe, there was not the leaſt word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the Plea upon this ground, becauſe the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was at the inſtance of the Defendant, or that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſhould not take advantage of the Plaintiffs diſability, for that he was a party to the Excommunication which diſabled him.</p>

            <p>And the reaſon why by ſuch Grants the Univerſity ſhall be barred, is, for that the diſability here inflicted on the Recuſant, is only a diſability to Preſent, or to grant the next Avoidance, which extends not to any of the Grants beforementioned, nor ſevers the Patronage from the Patron, as thoſe other Grants do.
